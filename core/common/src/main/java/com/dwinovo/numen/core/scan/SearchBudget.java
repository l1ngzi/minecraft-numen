/**
 * GLOBAL per-tick budget for every sliced world search on the server —
 * structure locating ({@link LocateStructureCompanionTask}), biome locating
 * ({@link LocateBiomeCompanionTask}) and long-range block scans
 * ({@link BlockSearch}). The Explorer's Compass {@code WorldWorkerManager}
 * model: total search cost per tick is a server constant, independent of how
 * many companions are searching at once — per-task budgets would stack
 * linearly with pet count.
 *
 * <h2>Fairness</h2>
 * First-come-first-served within a tick (entities tick in a stable order), so
 * concurrent searches effectively serialize: the first finishes in a few
 * ticks, then the next drains the pool. For companion-scale concurrency
 * that's strictly better than splitting the pool — total latency is the same
 * and the implementation stays trivial. Revisit with round-robin only if
 * dozens of simultaneous searches ever become real.
 *
 * <h2>The wall-clock lid counts search time only</h2>
 * Every consumer does its work inside a {@link #slice}; the 4ms lid is the sum of
 * this tick's slices, not the time since the first search of the tick. The world
 * ticks between the searches (locators run in the entity tick, block searches at
 * the end of it); counting that time too would hand whichever search runs later a
 * lid the world already spent, and a slow world tick would stall it for as long as
 * an earlier search kept running. The lid only paces: it decides where this tick's
 * work stops, never what a search concludes — every search ends on its own work
 * bound.
 *
 * <h2>Every slice moves</h2>
 * A slice always gets {@link #MIN_SLICE_NANOS} of its own, even when earlier slices
 * have spent the whole lid, so every consumer takes at least one step per tick. A
 * search's work is bounded, so it then comes back within a bounded number of ticks
 * however slow the machine or busy the other searches — the guarantee callers lean
 * on when they wait for a search before concluding anything. The cost is one step
 * per consumer per tick beyond the lid.
 *
 * <h2>Threading</h2>
 * Server main thread only, like everything in the task layer. The tick stamp
 * uses {@link MinecraftServer#getTickCount()} (monotonic, unaffected by
 * {@code /tick freeze}) to reset the pool exactly once per server tick.
