/**
 * Compiles a task's INTENT into the full navigation contract. Each static
 * factory IS an intent — there is deliberately no intent enum, the method
 * names are the vocabulary — and each returns the three things the navigation
 * and its task must agree on, derived together so they can never drift:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Compiled#goal()} — the search goal (which feet cells may end
 *       the path);</li>
 *   <li>{@link Compiled#sacred()} — the cells the route itself must leave
 *       untouched (may neither break nor bury: the table it travels to use,
 *       the ore its task will mine).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The load-bearing entry is {@link #block}: the replacement for the old
 * {@code resolveBlockGoal} fallback whose Euclidean {@code near(2.0)} sphere
 * admitted elevated cells (the geometry that let "place a scaffold, stand on
 * it" finish an approach) and marked nothing sacred (so a route could dig
 * through the very block it was travelling to).
