/**
 * The public entry point for feeding messages INTO a companion from outside
 * the chat GUI — Discord bridges, QQ bots, stream-chat relays, MCP servers,
 * anything.
 *
 * <h2>Deliberately unspecialized</h2>
 * This is the abstract "start()" on the base class: numen-api defines one
 * verb — <em>emit an input of a type for a companion</em>, the same verb as
 * {@link NumenApi#emit(UUID, String, String)} — and every integration decides
 * for itself what the string is. Provenance tags, rate limiting,
 * translation, permission checks: all caller-side. The input lands in the
 * companion's one event queue — the queue the chat GUI and the server's
 * events use — and is spliced into the conversation at the next
 * protocol-valid point: the owner's words exactly as if the owner had typed
 * them, a world event exactly like one the server sent.
 *
 * <h2>Outbound is not here — and never will be</h2>
 * Replies leave the companion through tools, not callbacks: register a
 * {@code NumenTool} (e.g. {@code send_qq_message}) via
 * {@code ToolRegistry.register} and the brain calls it when it has something
 * to say. Inbound = message queue, outbound = tool call. The tool-call queue
 * itself is likewise sealed: its entries are the products of an LLM decision,
 * each bound to a {@code tool_call_id} in the conversation protocol —
 * injecting one from outside would be operating the hands without the brain.
 *
 * <h2>Client-side API</h2>
 * Companions are driven by their owner's game client (the owner's API key
 * pays for the tokens), so this must be called in the owner's client process.
 * Safe from any thread — the emit itself is marshalled onto the client
 * main thread. Companion UUIDs come from the entity
 * ({@code entity.getUUID()}).

    /**
     * Queue {@code text} for {@code companion}, verbatim, as an input of {@code type}: either the owner's
     * words ({@link EventTypes#QUERY}) or a registered world event coming from this client — a bridge
     * relaying what someone else said, a live-stream comment. World events are wrapped as
     * {@code <event kind="type">} with the in-game time, exactly like the server's; how urgent they are
     * is that type's row. Things that happen to the body live on the server and go out through the body's
     * {@link NumenApi#emit(com.dwinovo.numen.entity.NumenPlayer, String, java.util.Map, String, boolean)}.
     * If the companion is idle this starts a turn immediately; if it is mid-task the message is
     * seen by the model at the next tool-batch boundary (queued messages merge
     * into one user message).
     *
     * <p>The agent loop is created on first contact: any companion on the
     * client's roster is addressable immediately after login — no need to have
     * opened its chat panel first. (Loops used to be panel-created only, which
     * made every quick-key/bridge message before the first panel visit vanish
     * with "not online".)

     * <p>返回的是<b>实际发生了什么</b>,不是对"她忙不忙"的推断——桥接方判"送没送到"
     * 就照这个判,自己另算一遍必然会跟真正的闸门跑偏。游戏内的聊天回显只记事不记状态,
     * 所以这几个值今天没有任何界面在读;它们是给外部集成的汇报,该说实话。
     *
     * @param companion the companion entity's UUID

     * @throws IllegalArgumentException {@code type} is neither the owner's words nor a registered world event
