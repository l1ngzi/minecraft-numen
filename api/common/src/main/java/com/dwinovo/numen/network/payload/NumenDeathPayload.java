/**
 * Server → Client: an Numen body died for good. The owner's client-side
 * {@link com.dwinovo.numen.client.agent.EntityAgentLoop} must stop — a dead
 * companion has no body to act through, so it must never call the LLM again.
 *
 * <h2>Why a dedicated signal</h2>
 * Without it, a loop whose body just died keeps dispatching tools and gets back
 * misleading {@code entity not found} / {@code not loaded on client} errors,
 * which the LLM misreads as a transient sync glitch and retries until the loop
 * guard trips. This payload makes death explicit: the loop is hard-stopped and
 * disposed, so no further LLM turns happen.
 *
 * <h2>Death is recoverable (not disposed)</h2>
 * The companion respawns at its owner after a delay (see {@link NumenRespawnPayload}), so the loop
 * is SUSPENDED, not disposed: {@code onEntityDied} abandons any in-flight tool calls, records the
 * cut-off turn as a Halt carrying the death cause (so the brain learns WHY it stopped) and latches it
 * idle. {@code cause} is the vanilla death message ("X was slain by a zombie") for that Halt.
