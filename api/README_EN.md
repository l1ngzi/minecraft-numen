## What it is

**numen-api** is the engine that powers the [Numen](https://github.com/Dwinovo/minecraft-numen) mod, packaged as a standalone project with a **stable public API**. The Numen mod bundles this engine; addons compile against it. Everything the companion can do — think, talk, move, mine, fight, remember — lives here; the mod is just one set of tools and skills stacked on top.

What the engine provides:

- **A client-side agent loop** (`EntityAgentLoop`) — hears a message, picks a tool, runs it, reads the result, decides the next move. The brain runs on the owner's own game client with the owner's own API key.
- **A tool contract** — `NumenTool` / `ToolRegistry` / `ToolCall` / `TaskResult`. A tool is any capability the companion can call; the engine schedules it and routes the result back into the conversation.
- **OpenAI-compatible LLM providers** — DeepSeek, DashScope (Qwen), OpenAI, Moonshot (Kimi), Zhipu (GLM), Minimax, SiliconFlow, Volcengine (Doubao). Transport is hand-rolled on the JDK's `HttpClient` + Gson, so there are **zero third-party runtime dependencies**.
- **Conversation memory** — persists across saves and auto-compacts (Claude-Code-style) when it grows long.
- **A companion body** — `NumenPlayer`, a server-side fake player (`ServerPlayer`). Every action runs through native player code paths, so redstone, mob AI, containers, and other mods treat it as a real player.
- **A skill system** — plain-text Markdown workflows that teach the companion how to play, loaded only when relevant.
- **Multi-loader** — one codebase across `common` / `fabric` / `forge` / `neoforge`.

## Public API

Addons touch the engine through three doors. Two feed a companion; one teaches it a new capability. Everything below is on the stable, published API surface.

### Door 1 — `NumenGateway`: feed the built-in brain

Hand a companion's **built-in brain** a message, verbatim. The engine splices it into the conversation at the next protocol-valid point, exactly as if the owner had typed it; the built-in LLM then decides what to do. This is how a plugin that carries an outside channel works — the QQ plugin turns a QQ message into an `enqueue`.

```java
import com.dwinovo.numen.api.NumenGateway;

// A message arrives from QQ / Discord / stream chat. Hand it to the companion's brain as-is.
boolean queued = NumenGateway.enqueue(companionUuid, "someone in QQ says: go mine me a stack of iron");
// queued == false only when the message is blank or that companion was never summoned this session.
```

Replies leave the companion by **calling a tool** (Door 3), not through a callback. Inbound = message queue; outbound = tool call. Safe to call from any thread; the enqueue is marshalled onto the client main thread.

### Door 2 — `NumenActuator`: drive the body from an external brain

Skip the built-in LLM entirely and drive a companion's **body** directly. The contract is **`acquire` → `invoke*` → `release`**: `acquire` pauses the built-in brain and frees the body so the two brains never fight over it; `invoke` runs any registered tool headlessly and returns a `CompletableFuture` of the result JSON; `release` hands control back. Every call is addressed to a companion UUID and bodies run tasks independently, so an external brain can acquire several companions and drive a **parallel fleet**. This is how the MCP server (numen-mcp) works.

```java
import com.dwinovo.numen.api.NumenActuator;
import java.util.UUID;

NumenActuator.companions().thenAccept(fleet -> {
    UUID body = fleet.get(0).uuid();
    NumenActuator.acquire(body)                                            // pause its built-in brain
        .thenCompose(ok -> NumenActuator.invoke(body, "move_to", "{\"x\":100,\"y\":64,\"z\":-200}"))
        .thenAccept(resultJson -> System.out.println(resultJson))          // a TaskResult JSON string
        .whenComplete((r, e) -> NumenActuator.release(body));              // always hand the body back
});
```

A headless `invoke` never touches the companion's conversation log — the external brain owns the context. Failures (unknown tool, bad args, a thrown tool) come back as a `TaskResult.fail` JSON, never an exceptional future. Any thread.

### Door 3 — `NumenTool` + `ToolRegistry.register`: teach a new capability

A tool is any capability the companion can call. Implement four methods and register the instance during mod init. There is deliberately **nothing about Minecraft on the contract** — a tool can drive the body, hook an external service, or call a web API; the engine only presents it to the LLM, delivers the call, and routes the result back.

```java
import com.dwinovo.numen.agent.tool.*;
import com.dwinovo.numen.task.TaskResult;
import java.util.Map;

public final class SendQqMessageTool implements NumenTool {
    public String name()        { return "send_qq_message"; }
    public String description() { return "Send a reply to the owner over QQ. Use when you have something to say to them."; }

    public Map<String, Object> parameterSchema() {
        return Map.of("type", "object",
                "properties", Map.of("text", Map.of("type", "string")),
                "required", java.util.List.of("text"));
    }

    public void invoke(ToolCall call) {
        String text = call.args().get("text").getAsString();
        // Do anything — run now, hop a thread, POST to an external service — then complete exactly once:
        myQqClient.send(text);
        call.complete(TaskResult.ok("sent to owner over QQ").toJson());
    }
}
```

```java
// during mod init:
ToolRegistry.register(new SendQqMessageTool());
```

`invoke` reports its result through the one verb, `ToolCall.complete(json)` — synchronously, or later after handing work off to another thread or the server body. `ToolRegistry.register` throws on a duplicate name and preserves registration order (stable tool order helps prompt caching).

### What is stable

The public API is the set of packages whose `package-info` declares them so, mirroring Applied Energistics 2's convention. Anything outside these packages — or annotated `@Internal` inside them — may change in any release.

| Package | Public types | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `com.dwinovo.numen.api` | `NumenGateway`, `NumenActuator` | the two doors that feed / drive a companion |
| `com.dwinovo.numen.agent.tool` | `NumenTool`, `ToolRegistry`, `ToolCall` | the tool contract + registration |
| `com.dwinovo.numen.agent.tool.api` | `ToolContext` | per-call context for a server-side tool |
| `com.dwinovo.numen.task` | `TaskResult` | the result envelope a tool hands back |
| `com.dwinovo.numen.entity` | `NumenPlayer` | the server-side companion body |

Everything else — providers, agent loop, memory, skill system, networking, UI — is `@Internal`. For a full worked reference, [numen-core](https://github.com/Dwinovo/minecraft-numen) builds its entire tool and skill set on exactly this surface, with no back doors.

## Depend on it

Artifacts are published to [numen-maven](https://github.com/Dwinovo/numen-maven). The coordinate carries the loader and Minecraft version:

```
com.dwinovo.numen:numen-api-<loader>-<mcversion>:<version>
```

Depend on the slim public-API jar (classifier `api`). At runtime the engine is **provided by the Numen mod**, which bundles it — an addon ships no engine code of its own.

```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dwinovo/numen-maven/main' }
}

dependencies {
    // Fabric: the slim jar carries intermediary names, same as the full jar. Use
    // modCompileOnly so Loom maps it into your own namespace — yarn or mojmap.
    modCompileOnly "com.dwinovo.numen:numen-api-fabric-1.20.1:<version>:api"

    // NeoForge / Forge: runtime names are Mojang names, so plain compileOnly works.
    // compileOnly "com.dwinovo.numen:numen-api-neoforge-1.20.1:<version>:api"
}
```

Swap the loader (`fabric` / `forge` / `neoforge`) and Minecraft version to match your target. Use the latest version from the badge at the top for `<version>`. This branch builds `1.20.1` on Java 21.

`numen-ai` (model access and usage accounting) and `numen-ui` (widgets) come along transitively — `IToolSpec`, which `NumenTool` extends, lives in `numen-ai`, so without it your tool will not compile. Their coordinates carry the MC-version suffix too: the code itself has nothing to do with Minecraft, but the copy on each version branch is not currently the same.

**To change engine mechanics themselves**, depend on core:

```gradle
dependencies {
    // Fabric
    modImplementation "com.dwinovo.numen:numen-fabric-1.20.1:<version>"

    // NeoForge / Forge (there is no modImplementation there — that's a Loom keyword)
    // implementation "com.dwinovo.numen:numen-neoforge-1.20.1:<version>"
}
```

core pulls the matching `numen-api-*` in with it — no second line needed. The engine's types appear in core's own public signatures (`AbstractCompanionTask<R extends TaskRecord>` and friends), so it is an `api` dependency, not a runtime one.

> Do not depend on either family's `-common` coordinate (`numen-api-common-*` / `numen-common-*`). They hold only the cross-loader code: no loader entrypoint; `numen-api-common-*` also has no language files, and `numen-common-*` does not nest the engine. They compile, and then do nothing in game. **The loader-named coordinate is the complete one.**

---

## Build & publish

Standard MultiLoader-Template layout (`common` + per-loader subprojects).

```bash
./gradlew build         # build every loader
./gradlew datagenAll    # run data generation for both families, both loaders
./gradlew publishAll    # publish api + core + ai + ui
./gradlew releaseJars   # collect the jar each loader ships to players into build/release/<loader>/
```

The target repo comes from `local_maven_url` in `gradle.properties`, which defaults to the in-repo `build/local-maven` — that is where day-to-day debugging publishes; override with `-Plocal_maven_url=...`. `datagenAll` / `publishAll` / `releaseJars` pick the branch's second loader (Forge or NeoForge) themselves — callers never need to know which.

Artifacts fall into three kinds: the full jar (runtime, bundled by the Numen mod), the slim `api`-classifier jar (what addons `compileOnly`), and sources / javadoc.

**Versions are locked in step across the tree**, with a single source: `version` in `gradle.properties`. api, core, ai and ui all share it, so "which api goes with which mod" never comes up — mod 0.1.3 takes api 0.1.3, and it is also the version shown in game. The docs carry no concrete version: coordinates say `<version>`, and the badge at the top reads numen-maven directly.

**Releasing is one click on GitHub:** Actions → Publish → Run workflow, pick the branch (that is, the MC version) and the channel (beta / release). From the command line:

```bash
gh workflow run publish.yml --ref 1.20.1 -f channel=beta
```

One run covers both audiences: it builds once; pushes the artifacts to numen-maven for developers and tags `v<version>-<mc>[-beta]` to pin that version to this commit; uploads the jars to Modrinth and CurseForge for players; and finally creates the GitHub Release. The changelog is the `feat` / `fix` commits since the previous version. If this version was already released on this MC, or this commit's Build is not green, it stops before touching anything. If something fails halfway, use Re-run failed jobs on that run — only the failed parts run again.

## Ecosystem

**Numen** ([minecraft-numen](https://github.com/Dwinovo/minecraft-numen)) is the mod — the AI companion. The engine (`api/`), the MCP server and the mod itself all live in this one repository; the engine is also published through **[numen-maven](https://github.com/Dwinovo/numen-maven)** and exposes a small public API.

Two things build on it:

**A plugin** is a third-party mod that gives a companion new abilities through the public API. It does two things: registers tools through `NumenGateway`, and ships a `/skills` directory inside its own jar. The companion's own brain stays in charge — the plugin supplies the capability, the companion decides whether and when to use it.

**A skill** is markdown that teaches a companion how to behave, loaded into its context only when relevant. Bundled with Numen, community-written, or shipped inside a plugin's jar.

As for **handing the controls to an outside brain** (any external agent driving companions directly), that is the built-in MCP server — nothing extra to install. See [External brain](#external-brain).
